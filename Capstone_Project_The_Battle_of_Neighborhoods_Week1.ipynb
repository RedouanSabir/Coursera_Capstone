    "(21,498/kmÂ² - 53,000/sq mi).\n",
    "As a consequence the real estate prices are amongst the highest in the world ( 8th in the world with 14,017.63 $  per square meter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Paris being a city where relatively few people possess a car (due to excessive taxes and parking fees). So a car rental agency can be a juicy business because a lot of residents may need ponctually car\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project let's put ourselves in the shoes of an entrepeneur looking to open a car rental agency. So for the location we have to find a balance between the real estate prices and the presence of competitors. The vicinity of a major railway station will be an asset as well\n",
